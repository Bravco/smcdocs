## Trends

To determine the market trend, we focus on the latest price leg between the most recent **Swing High** and **Swing Low**.

Minor moves in between are ignored unless price closes above the Swing High or below the Swing Low, signaling a possible **continuation** or **reversal**.

A **bullish trend** is made of **higher highs** and **higher low**s.

A **bearish trend** is made of **lower highs** and **lower lows**.

## Market Structure Shift (MSS)

A **Market Structure Shift (MSS)** occurs when a candle body closes above a previous Swing High or below a Swing Low, signaling a potential trend reversal.
