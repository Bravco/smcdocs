> Most traders don't fail because they have a bad strategy, but because their **psychology sucks**.

Most common psychology mistakes are:

1. **Over risking & overleveraging**
2. **Overtrading**
3. **Revenge trading**
4. **Fear of losing money**
5. **Fear of missing out (FOMO)**
6. **Overconfidence**
7. **Greed**
8. **Impatience**
9. **Fear of being wrong**

But every issue can be fixed.

1. Practice correct risk management.
2. Limit yourself to take max 2 trades a day.
3. After a loss, stay disciplined and stick to your rules.
4. De-risk to an amount you are comfortable losing.
5. There is opportunity to make money every trading day.
6. Market does not care and will destroy your ego.
7. Trading is not a get rich quick scheme.
8. Wait for your setup and only then take a trade.
9. Losses are part of trading and nothing is certain, but fear leads to missed setups.

Overall, you need to adopt an **Abundance Mindset**, which is a belief that there are plentiful opportunities for success and profit in the market, rather than a limited, fixed amount.

## Journaling

Reflecting on your past trades is where the growth happens.

A trading journal will help you determine your perfect **A+ setup** and see which variables worsen your probability.
