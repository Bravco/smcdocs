No matter your win rate, the odds of losing 10 trades in a row are higher than you think.

Proper risk management is the only way to avoid liquidating your account.

Profitability is simply a net positive relationship between win rate and risk-to-reward ratio (RR).

You can be profitable with a 60% win rate at 1:1RR, just as you can with a 20% win rate at 1:5RR.

## Best Risk Percentages

- Risk a fixed amount per trade, based on your win rate
    - **Live acount:** 1-3% of your capital
    - **Prop firms:** 5-10% of **max drawdown**

::info
On a funded account, your effective capital is the max drawdown, not the full account size.
